# Competitive Programming Black Box

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures commonly used in competitive programming, implemented in [insert programming language(s) used]. The purpose of this "black box" is to provide a centralized hub for my personal competitive programming endeavors, where I can store and refine my solutions to various problems.

The algorithms and data structures included in this repository are designed to be efficient, optimized, and easy to understand. They are intended to be used as a reference or starting point for solving problems on platforms such as LeetCode, CodeForces, and others.

## Features

* Implementation of popular algorithms such as binary search, dynamic programming, and graph traversal
* Optimized solutions for common problem types, such as sorting, searching, and graph problems
* Modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository, and use the algorithms and data structures as you see fit. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
